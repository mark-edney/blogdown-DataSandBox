The final project for the Machine Learning course for Johns Hopkins University
Data Science Specialization. The project looks at the data collected for different
smart fitness trackers. The project uses machine learning to classify the level of
activity based on a wide variety of variables.

The individual steps are outlined in a paper published on RPubs [here](https://rpubs.com/m2edney/ML_final). 
It outlines the use of the following models:

* Random forest
* Generalized Boosted
* Linear Discriminant
* Combined
