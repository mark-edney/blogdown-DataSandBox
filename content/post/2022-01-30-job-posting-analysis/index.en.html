<p>Recently there was a post on medium about the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
to study a job posting for keywords. I found that this article was very similar to
R shiny App that I created a while ago. <a href="#section-fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="section-fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<div id="section-introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Technology has changed the job application process, making it easier and quicker to
apply to jobs. As a result, the average job posting will receive around 250 resumes.
<a href="#section-fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="section-fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> So how can hiring managers handle spending their time looking through that
many resumes for one posting? That’s easy, they cheat.</p>
<p>Hiring Managers no longer look at individual resumes but use automatic software called
applicant tracking system (ATS). These programs filter resumes by a set of keywords,
reducing the amount of resumes to a more manageable amount. So how can a job applicant
make sure their resume is looked at? Well, they should cheat.</p>
<p>The medium article I mentioned uses Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
to skim through the job posting to look for the most common words used. This is useful
information but not necessarily the keywords used by the ATS software. I propose the
use of a R Shiny App to filter a job posting by a list of common keywords.</p>
<p>An R Shiny App is a interactive web based application that runs R code. The syntax
for a Shiny App is a little different than R and requires some additional understanding.
The product will be a basic, interactive program that can be hosted online. One free
Shiny App hosting site that I recommend is <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io">shinyapps.io</a>.</p>

<div id="section-inialization" class="section level2">
<h2>Inialization</h2>
<p>The shiny App will require the following libraries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(shiny)
library(wordcloud2)
library(tidyverse)
library(XML)
library(rvest)
library(tidytext)</code></pre>
<p>The Shiny App will use a csv files which contains a set of keywords that ATS will
look for in a resume. This list was found online but I have modified by adding additional
keywords as I see fit. The file can be download <a href="">here</a> from my github site. Here
is a sample of some of the keywords:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Keywords &lt;- read_csv(&quot;Keywords.csv&quot;) 
Keywords$Keys %&gt;% head()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;.NET&quot;                &quot;account management&quot;  &quot;accounting&quot;         
## [4] &quot;accounts payable&quot;    &quot;accounts receivable&quot; &quot;acquisition&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-app-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>App Structure</h2>
<p>One issue I found when developing this application was the use of keywords that are
a combination of multiple words.</p>
