## Introduction

As a continuation from my previous post exploring the use of the Stargazer library to create better looking tables, I though I would look into the GT library. The GT library takes a different approach by creating an object class with the GT function. It is still able to create great looking tables in html or latex but also adds support for RTF. 

## GT Library Intuitation

The use of the GT library  is pretty simple and starts with the creation of a GT object. For this example I will use the ChickenWeight database that looks at the weights of different chickens. 

```{r Inialization, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(gt)
library(tidyverse)
data("ChickWeight")
```

The dataframe or tibble is passed into the GT function which can be passed into additional modifier functions. This is better outlined and easier understood using the piping operator from the magrittr library which is also included in the tidyverse library. The piping operator is incredibly useful and common.

```{r step1}
ChickWeight %>% head() %>% gt()
```
The result is a simple a clean table the displays the required data. There is a set structure for the GT objects which is outlined in the following diagram:

## Function Chaining

As previously mentioned, by chaining GT functions together we can add elements to the table. These elements can include titles, foot notes, source notes and conditional formatting similar to what you would use in an excel table. 

```{r chains}
ChickWeight %>%
        head() %>%
        gt() %>%
        tab_header(
                title = "Chicken Weight data", 
                subtitle = "remember to weight your chickens!"
        ) %>%
        tab_footnote(footnote = "measured in seconds",
                     locations = cells_column_labels(Time)) %>%
        tab_source_note(source_note = "From ChickenWeight Database") %>%
        tab_style(style = cell_fill(color = "red"),
                  locations = cells_body(
                          columns = weight,
                          rows = weight > 50
                  ))
```

## Helper functions
From the previous code includes smaller helper functions with the element functions.
