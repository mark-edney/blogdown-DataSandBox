<p>Dashboards are a great way to demonstrate knowledge and engage decision makers. Their utility has made PowerBI and
Tableau household names. And while these solutions do support <code>R</code> and <code>Python</code> scripts and visualizations, the <code>Flexdashboard</code> package seeks to compete. The <code>Flexdashboard</code> packages does this all in <code>R</code> with the simplicity of writing a <code>R Markdown</code> file.</p>

<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
<p>The setup is simple, you just need to download and load the <code>Flexdashboard</code> package. With the package installed, the easiest way to start is by creating a new <code>R Markdown</code> file using the <code>Flexdashboard</code> template. Loading the <code>Shiny</code> package is useful if you would like to use interactive plots, but it is not necessary.</p>
<p>The dashboard can be laid out by either columns or by rows, it doesn’t really make a difference. Just change the text of columns with rows in the following walk-through. A column is set up with “## Column” as the header. The size of the plot region can then be modified with “{data-width=”500”}” in the same header line. The next line should be the plot/area title, which is included with “### Plot Title” header. All that is left is to include a code chunk with your plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(flexdashboard)
library(shiny)</code></pre>

<h2>Sample Data</h2>
<p>I decided to demonstrate different dashboard features with a data set from <code>Open Canada</code> about charitable donations. More information can be found <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/74c77af4-73c4-4e0d-ac5d-f74a247cdf12">here</a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>download.file(&quot;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/tbl/csv/45100007-eng.zip&quot;, &quot;donordata.zip&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="sample-dashboard-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Sample Dashboard 1</h2>
<p>The first dashboard was set up with the default columns layout. It includes an interactive bar chart, an interactive box plot and a pie chart. All the plot were created with <code>GGplot2</code>, the two plot were made interactive with the <code>GGplotly</code> function from the <code>Plotly</code> package. I created a pie chart to demonstrate the use of regular ggplots and because I recently read a complaint about <code>GGplot2</code> for the creation of Pie charts on Reddit. In my opinion, Pie charts are not very good very conveying information.</p>

<h2>Sample Dashboard 2</h2>
<p>For the second dashboard, I used the row layout. The process is that same with no additional complications. The dashboard features an interactive Leaflet plot, an interactive histogram and data table using the <code>GT</code> package. The table was transformed with Pivot_Wider function to better fill the space.</p>

<div id="conclusions" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The <code>Flexdashboard</code> package can be used to create nice looking dashboards with a great level of control. The plots can also include interactive elements. When compared to PowerBi or Tableau, there remains one major deficiency. These other dashboards contain a smart interactive filter which ties all the plots together. If you select a specific element in one plot for filtering, all other plots have the same filter applied to them. This is a major boon for understanding data and not a simple feature to develop in <code>Flexdashboard</code>. It remains an interesting package, but I would still rely on PowerBI or Tableau to create dashboards.</p>
