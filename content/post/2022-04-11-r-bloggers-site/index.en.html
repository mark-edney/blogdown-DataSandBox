<p>I would like to take the time to mention the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://r-bloggers.com&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1649728986132366&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vAkyuJT7uhjS9BQpH-Upw">r-bloggers</a> site. It is a vast collection of Blogs on everything that has to do will the R language. I would very much like to contribute to their work with this blog.</p>
<p>Just to keep it interesting, I would like to recommend this specific post by <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/04/upcoming-r-conferences-2022/">The Jumping Rivers Blog</a> about upcoming R conferences. Iâ€™ve attended a few digital R Conferences, hosted by R-Studio, and they are very rewarding experiences. They have the ability to both inspire and educate. Unfortunately, there are no conferences in my native Canada.</p>
