<p>I have recently been on a tear of different challenges on the site <a href="hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a>. I am about halfway through their 30 days of code and 10 days of statistics. These challenges often require to output number to a certain a number of significant digits. I’ve always thought that the <code>round</code> function can be used for this, but I am wrong. The F string seems to be a powerful tool to accomplish this, and worth your time learning if you are unfamiliar.</p>

<h2>Structure of an F string</h2>
<p>The formatting of an F string starts with a <code>f</code> prior to quotations, whether they be single or double quotes. Any variable can then be included within a series of <code>{}</code>. This formatting can make it easier than turning values into strings and concatenating all strings into a single line of text. This is easily demonstrated with a large mix of values and strings.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>x = 1/3
y = 1/6

print(&quot;The value is &quot; + str(x) + &quot; is greater than &quot; + str(y))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The value is 0.3333333333333333 is greater than 0.16666666666666666</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>print(f&quot;The value is {x} is greater than {y}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The value is 0.3333333333333333 is greater than 0.16666666666666666</code></pre>
<p>The values can then be formatted with <code>:</code> after the variable name. The number of digits prior and post the decimal can then be specified. The <code>f</code> is added after the decimal formatting to ensure the value is treated as a float.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>print(f&quot;The value is {x:.3f} is greater than {y:.2f}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The value is 0.333 is greater than 0.17</code></pre>
<p>The values passed are not specific to the number of digits, but the minimum number of spaces. This means you can ensure specific space aligned, such as for a table, by including these values.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>z = [10000, 500, 10, 0.001, .1]
for i in z:
        print(f&quot;the value is: {i:5}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## the value is: 10000
## the value is:   500
## the value is:    10
## the value is: 0.001
## the value is:   0.1</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, we can add leading zeros by adding zero prior to the number of digits.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for i in z:
        print(f&quot;the value is: {i:05}&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## the value is: 10000
## the value is: 00500
## the value is: 00010
## the value is: 0.001
## the value is: 000.1</code></pre>

<div id="alternative-formatting" class="section level2">
<h2>Alternative formatting</h2>
<p>There are a few alternative methods for f strings. From my understanding, they are not as fast when it comes to performance. I don’t think that is of particular importance. If your script needs a high level of performance, than you probably don’t want many print statements.</p>
<div id="format-method" class="section level3">
<h3>Format Method()</h3>
<p>The <code>format</code> method is very similar to <code>f strings</code> with the use of the <code>{}</code>. The string is not preceded by f and the <code>{}</code> can remain empty or contain position indexing. The values are then added in the <code>.format</code> function after the string. The order of the variable in the string will correspond with the number used in the <code>{}</code>, if used at all.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>print(&quot;The value is {} is greater than {}&quot;.format(1/3, 1/6))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The value is 0.3333333333333333 is greater than 0.16666666666666666</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="old-method" class="section level3">
<h3>Old % Method</h3>
<p>The Old % operator (modulo) replaces the value in the string. Formatting details, such as those previously discussed, are entered after the <code>%</code>. The variables or values are then entered after the string when preceded by another <code>%</code>. Multiple values can be passed.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>print(&quot;The value is %5.3f is greater than %5.3f&quot; %(x,y))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The value is 0.333 is greater than 0.167</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusions" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Whichever method you decide, it probably won’t make a huge difference. The important part is to understand is the actual formatting. F strings also seem to make it easier to understand the code, as the actual values are inline with the string and the formatting.</p>
