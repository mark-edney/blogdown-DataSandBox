I have spent awhile learning Python and I was a little perplexed when it came to list comprehensions. Why would you use them? Isn't there just an easier why?

As my proficiency increase, I have found them to be an incredibly usefull tool. They save you lines of code, are easy to understand and are usually better for performance. A good list comprehension, is truly a work of beauty.
