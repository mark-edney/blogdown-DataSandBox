      <description>I would like to take the time to mention the r-bloggers site. It is a vast collection of Blogs on everything that has to do will the R language. I would very much like to contribute to their work with this blog.
Just to keep it interesting, I would like to recommend this specific post by The Jumping Rivers Blog about upcoming R conferences. Iâ€™ve attended a few digital R Conferences, hosted by R-Studio, and they are very rewarding experiences.</description>
