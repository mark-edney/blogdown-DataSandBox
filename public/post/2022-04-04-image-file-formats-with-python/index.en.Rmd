I recently had to change a image from an SVG to a PNG in order to post it on [Medium](https://medium.com/@m2edney). I was unable to simply save the image as a different file format on my computer so I used an online file converter. The problem with these website is that I have no idea what they intend to do with that image. This wasn't an image that I had ownership rights but if I did, I could be forfeiting them in order to change the file format. So I thought, maybe there is a better way with a python script.  

```{python intro}
from PIL import Image
```

```{python input}
img = Image.open(input())

```
