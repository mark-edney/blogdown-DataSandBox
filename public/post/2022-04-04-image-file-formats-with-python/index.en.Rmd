I recently had to change a image from an SVG to a PNG in order to post it on [Medium](https://medium.com/@m2edney). I was unable to simply save the image as a different file format on my computer so I used an online file converter. The problem with these website is that I have no idea what they intend to do with that image. This wasn't an image that I had ownership rights but if I did, I could be forfeiting them in order to change the file format. So I thought, maybe there is a better way with a python script.  

```{python intro}
from svglib.svglib import svg2rlg
from reportlab.graphics import renderPDF, renderPM
```

```{python input}
img = svg2rlf(input())
img = svg2rlf(input())
svglib.

```

```{python convert}
outfile = os.path.splitext(infile)[0] + ".thumbnail"
    if infile != outfile:
        try:
            with Image.open(infile) as im:
                im.thumbnail(size)
                im.save(outfile, "JPEG")
        except OSError:
            print("cannot create thumbnail for", infile)
```
```{python pdfs}
from PyPDF2 import PdfFileMerger

pdfs = ['file1.pdf', 'file2.pdf', 'file3.pdf', 'file4.pdf']

merger = PdfFileMerger()

for pdf in pdfs:
    merger.append(pdf)

merger.write("result.pdf")
merger.close()
```
```{r}
library(blogdown)
```
