      <description>I have recently been on a tear of different challenges on the site HackerRank. I am about halfway through their 30 days of code and 10 days of statistics. These challenges often require to output number to a certain a number of significant digits. I’ve always thought that the round function can be used for this, but I am wrong. The F string seems to be a powerful tool to accomplish this, and worth your time learning if you are unfamiliar.</description>

      <description>How do you become a better programmer? Well, there is strong scientific evidence for the support of the principle of deliberate practice. Deliberate practice is a method of skill development first written by Anders Ericsson in the book “Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise”. I would also recommend reading “Talent Is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else” by Geoff Colvin.
Deliberate PracticeDeliberate Practice can be summarized to the following points:</description>

      <title>Dashboards in R with Shiny Dashboard</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I explore the Flex dashboard library for the creation of a clean and interactive dashboard. That post can be found here. Unknown to me at the time, but I sort of skipped over the more natural progression of creating a dashboard with R Shiny. This is my attempt to recreate that dashboard and compare the ease of creation and functionality of the Shinydashboard library.</description>

      <description>I am currently looking for a new job, which means I need to create many resumes and cover letters. When creating a resume, it is good practice to create a PDF file. PDFs cannot be edited, which can make them difficult to work with, but they retain their formatting. It is impossible to tell which version of Microsoft Word a hiring manager is using. So you have to risk a possible formatting error or create a compatible resumes without the latest features.</description>

      <description>When I started learning R, I heard vague tales of the use of Data Tables. Really just whisperers, of something to consider in the future after I’ve become more proficient. Well now is the time to learn what if anything I’ve been missing out on.
IntroductionData Tables are a potential replacement for the common dataframe. It seeks to perform that same role but with improved performance. I would like to see the speed comparison between Data Frames, Data Tables and Tibbles.</description>

      <description>I would like to take the time to mention the r-bloggers site. It is a vast collection of Blogs on everything that has to do will the R language. I would very much like to contribute to their work with this blog.
Just to keep it interesting, I would like to recommend this specific post by The Jumping Rivers Blog about upcoming R conferences. I’ve attended a few digital R Conferences, hosted by R-Studio, and they are very rewarding experiences.</description>

      <description>I sit here looking for inspiration, nothing interesting to write about. Perhaps there are some popular R packages on CRAN that I don’t know about? You can explore the data on downloads from CRAN with the cranlogs package.
Top CRAN downloadsWith the following code we can get the most popular packages from CRAN. The CRAN directory doesn’t represent all R packages but a good amount of them.</description>

      <title>Simple Neural Networks in Python</title>

      <description>Neural Networks (NN) have become incredibly popular due to their high level of accuracy. The creation of a NN can be complicated and have a high level of customization. I wanted to explore just the simplest NN that you could create. A framework as a workhorse for developing new NN.
The SciKitlearn provides the easiest solution with the Multi-Layer Perceptron series of functions. It doesn’t provide a bunch of the more advanced features of TensorFlow, like GPU support, but that is not what I’m looking for.</description>

      <title>Making the Connection with Crosstalk</title>

      <description>I recently wrote a post about creating dashboards in R which was based on the Flexdashboard library. My largest criticism was the lack of communication between visualizations on the same dashboard. This was before I learned about the Crosstalk package which adds this feature to html widgets, such as the Flexdashboard, to at least a limited degree.
InitializationThe Crosstalk package is available on CRAN and is loaded along with other important packages for this demonstration.</description>

      <description>Dashboards are a great way to demonstrate knowledge and engage decision makers. Their utility has made PowerBI andTableau household names. And while these solutions do support R and Python scripts and visualizations, the Flexdashboard package seeks to compete. The Flexdashboard packages does this all in R with the simplicity of writing a R Markdown file.
Initial SetupThe setup is simple, you just need to download and load the Flexdashboard package.</description>

      <title>Python in R Markdown</title>

The main advantage of using the R Markdown format is the utility of running R code within the text. This is clearly more advantageous than just writing code in a Markdown file. RMarkdown is however limited to R code, unable to run Python scripts. The R library reticulate looks to add this capability.
Initial SetupThe initial setup requires the installation of the reticulate library, after installation you shouldn’t need to call it, but I do in the preceding code.</description>

IntroductionAs a continuation from my previous post exploring the use of the Stargazer library to create better looking tables, I thought I would look into the GT library. The GT library takes a different approach by creating an object class with the GT function. It is still able to create great looking tables in html or latex, but also adds support for RTF.</description>

      <description>This post was inspired by the following youtube video.
IntroductionTables from regression models or just plain data in R are poorly organized. The havelittle formatting and are unfit for publishing. This point is illustrated with theCO2 dataset. This dataset looks at the CO2 uptake of six different types of grass.

      <description>Recently, there was a post on medium about the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP)to study a job posting for keywords. I found that this article was very similar toR shiny App that I created a while ago. 1
IntroductionTechnology has changed the job application process, making it easier and quicker toapply to jobs. As a result, the average job posting will receive around 250 resumes.</description>
