      <description>I recently wrote a post about creating dashboards in R which was based on the Flexdashboard library. My largest criticism was the lack of communication between visualizations on the same dashboard. This was before I learned about the Crosstalk package which adds this feature to html widgets, such as the Flexdashboard, to at least a limited degree.
InitializationThe Crosstalk package is available on CRAN and is loaded along with other important packages for this demonstration.</description>

      <description>Dashboards are a great way to demonstrate knowledge and engage decision makers. Their utility has made PowerBI andTableau household names. And while these solutions do support R and Python scripts and visualizations, the Flexdashboard package seeks to compete. The Flexdashboard packages does this all in R with the simplicity of writing a R Markdown file.
Initial SetupThe setup is simple, you just need to download and load the Flexdashboard package.</description>
