      <description>Neural Networks (NN) have become incredibly popular due to their high level of accuracy. The creation of a NN can be complicated and have a high level of customization. I wanted to explore just the simplest NN that you could create. A framework as a workhorse for developing new NN.
The SciKitlearn provides the easiest solution with the Multi-Layer Perceptron series of functions. It doesn’t provide a bunch of the more advanced features of TensorFlow, like GPU support, but that is not what I’m looking for.</description>
