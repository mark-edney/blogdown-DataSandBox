Executive SummaryThis report analyzes collected data on different users preforming barbell liftsperformed at different levels of quality. A machine learning algorithm was usedto create a model to determine the users rating based on data collected from multipleaccelerometers. More information on the project can be found here.
AnalysisInitializationThe following code was used to initialize the required r libraries as well as downloadingthe required data and store it into memory.</description>
