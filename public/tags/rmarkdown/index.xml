      <description>I recently wrote a post about creating dashboards in R which was based on the Flexdashboard library. My largest criticism was the lack of communication between visualizations on the same dashboard. This was before I learned about the Crosstalk package which adds this feature to html widgets, such as the Flexdashboard, to at least a limited degree.
InitializationThe Crosstalk package is available on CRAN and is loaded along with other important packages for this demonstration.</description>

      <description>Dashboards are a great way to demonstrate knowledge and engage decision makers. Their utility has made PowerBI andTableau household names. And while these solutions do support R and Python scripts and visualizations, the Flexdashboard package seeks to compete. The Flexdashboard packages does this all in R with the simplicity of writing a R Markdown file.
Initial SetupThe setup is simple, you just need to download and load the Flexdashboard package.</description>

The main advantage of using the R Markdown format is the utility of running R code within the text. This is clearly more advantageous than just writing code in a Markdown file. RMarkdown is however limited to R code, unable to run Python scripts. The R library reticulate looks to add this capability.
Initial SetupThe initial setup requires the installation of the reticulate library, after installation you shouldnâ€™t need to call it, but I do in the preceding code.</description>
